# Object-tracking-and-detection-using-Python-OpenCV-and-YOLOV3
This was the final project of the image processing course of the Mechatronics Engineering course together with my partner and friend Jes√∫s Alejandro Vazquez. In this project we performed the detection of objects using YOLOv3, and then we selected one of the detected classes to track the objects of the selected class.
